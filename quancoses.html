        <h1>Section 3</h1>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language</i> and is used to build the structure of a document.</p>

        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <div>Elements are used in HTML to help separate, distinguish, categorize, etc. parts of a webpage.</div>
        <div>Syntax for an element: <b>&lt;<i> element type </i>&gt;<i> stuff </i>&lt; /<i> element type &gt;</i></p>
            </b> </div>

        <h3>Examples of Elements</h3>

        <div><b>Paragraph Element</b> - This is a block level element, so it will space itself with other elements.
        </div>
        <span>&lt;p&gt; <i>your paragraph...</i> &lt;/p&gt;</b></span>

        <div><b>Division Element</b> - Much like a paragraph element, this is a block-level element allowing for
            division of sections. This is good for grouping things together. But if another type of block-level element
            exists, use that instead. A div should really only be used as a last resort.</div>
        <div><b>Span Element</b> - Spans are inline elements. These can also be used for grouping things, such as
            individual words within a sentence. For example, when applying css to a nhtml document, adding spans within
            a paragraph can allow you to edit specific words in a sentence.</div>
        <span>&lt;div&gt; <i>your content...</i> &lt;/div&gt;</span>

        <div><b>h1 through h6 Elements</b> - These are header elements. There can only be a single h1 on a page, and the
            numerical value must be in ascending order. e.g. h2 must come before an h3, and an h3 must come before an
            h4.</div>
        <span>&lt;h1&gt; <i>your main header</i> &lt;/h1&gt;</span>
        <div>&lt;h2&gt; <i>your subheader</i> &lt;/h2&gt;</div>

        <h2>HTML Boilerplate</h2>
        <p>This is standardized markup that needs to be in every html document.</p>

        <h3>Boilerplate Parts</h3>

        <div><b>Doctype</b> - This tells the broswer what type of document it is reading.</div>
        <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

        <div><b>HTML Element</b> - This is the top-level element. Everything needs to go in here.</div>
        <span>&lt;html lang="en"&gt; <i>all your shit</i> &lt;/html&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Title</b> - This is the title of the page which is displayed in the browser tab. Browsers use the title
            element to create the links in the search results.</div>
        <span>&lt;title&gt; <i>your title</i> &lt;/title&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Head</b> - This is where all the metadata wil go.</div>
        <span>&lt;head&gt; <i>metadata</i> &lt;/head&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Body</b> - This is where all the content of the document will go.</div>
        <span>&lt;body&gt; <i>touch my body</i> &lt;/body&gt;</span>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <span>Lists can be nested inside one another (both ordered and unordered.)</span>

        <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
        <span>These are lists of things where order is not necessarily needed. This is done by creating a tag named ul
            with tags named li nested within. </span>

        <div>Syntax for unordered lists:</div>
        <div><b>&lt;<i>ul</i>&gt;</b></div>
        <span><b><i> &lt;<i>li</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/li</i>&gt;..... </i></b></span>
        <div><b>&lt; /<i>ul&gt;</i></p></b></div>

        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <span>These are lists where having an order is wanted. This is done by creating a tag named ol with tags named
            li nested within. </span>

        <div>Syntax for ordered lists:</div>
        <div><b>&lt;<i>ol</i>&gt;</b></div>
        <span><b><i> &lt;<i>li</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/li</i>&gt;..... </i></b></span>
        <div><b>&lt; /<i>ol&gt;</i></p></b></div>

        <h2>Anchor Tags</h2>
        <span>Anchor tags are typically used for providing a clickable link for navigation to another location. This is
            done by opening an 'a' tag, having the address specified immedietely after the a, naming the clickable
            portion between the tags, followed by a closing tag. When adding the location in the href attribute, the
            link will take you to the location relative to the current directory, if not otherwise specified. So, if we
            are working in a local directory and you want the link to go to google, make sure to add the
            http://www.</span>

        <div>Syntax for an anchor tag: <b><i> &lt;<i>a href="location"</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/a</i>&gt; </i></b></div>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <span>There is only an opening tag for images. Much like the href attribute for an anchor tag, there is an
            attribute named src for images. Same with the anchor tag, the location of the image used is relative to the
            current html file being used. Another attribute may be used to help with accessibility, which is the alt
            attribute. This can be placed right after the src attribute which allows for a text description of the
            image. This will only show if the image cannot load properly, or if someone is using a screen reader.</span>
        <div><b>Syntax for Images: <i> &lt;<i>img src="img location"</i>&gt;</i></b></div>
        <div><b>Syntax for Images with alt attribute: <i> &lt;<i>img src="img location"
                        alt="description"</i>&gt;</i></b></div>


    </div>

    <div id="sectionFour">
        <h1>Section 4</h1>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Inline elements only take up the space that they need, so the extra space can be filled with something else.
        </p>
        <p>Examples of inline elements: spans, images, anchor tags</p>

        <h2>Block Elements</h2>
        <p>Block elements take up the entire line (block), so even if your content doesn't fill up the whole line, that
            extra space will still be reserved.</p>
        <p>Examples of block elements: divs, paragraphs, h1, h2, ...</p>
        <p>More about block elements, inline elements, and inline-block elements will be covered in css.</p>

        <h2>List of Elements</h2>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Here</a> is a link to all of the elements
            listed on MDN.</p>

        <h2>Entity Codes</h2>
        <p>These are codes for specific characters that we cannot normally type in. They all start with an '&' and end
            with an ';'. These should also be used for <b>Reserved characters</b>. These are characters such as '&lt;'
            and '&amp;'. Since they have a specific purpose in html, just typing it in normally might result in some
            confusion/problems. <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">Here</a> is a link to entity
            codes.</p>

        <h2>Semantic Markup (Meaningful Markup)</h2>
        <p>When choosing a type of element, try to choose one that has the best meaning for its purpose. For example,
            the 'main' element functions exactly like the generic 'div' element, but it indicates that the content
            inside is the main. Main and div function exactly the same, but main helps explain to people reading the
            code that what goes inside that element is the main content. These content sectioning elements can be seen
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning">here</a>.

    <div id="sectionFive">
        <h1>Section Five</h1>
        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <div><b>Table Elements</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;table&gt;: table element- everything just goes inside of this element</li>
            <li>&lt;td&gt;: table data cell element- defines a cell within a table</li>
            <li>&lt;tr&gt;: table row element- groups cells into a row</li>
            <li>&lt;th&gt;: table header cell element- defines a cell as being a header</li>
            <li>&lt;thead&gt;: table head element- groups rows into a head </li>
            <li>&lt;tbody&gt;: table body element- groups rows that are in the body of the table</li>
            <li>&lt;tfoot&gt;: table foot element- defines what rows are considered a footer</li>
            <li>&lt;colgroup&gt;: colgroup element- defines a group of columns in a table</li>
            <li>&lt;caption&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;col&gt;: col element- This is usually found within a colgroup element. Includes the attribute 'span'
            </li>
            <li>col span and row span can also just go inside of something like a td</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Honestly didn't feel like doing this section so I will just leave a link <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#table_content">here</a> to look at.
        </div>
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <div><b>Form elements</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;form&gt;: form element- This is basically just a shell for the other form elements to go into. It
                also specifies where the form data should be submitted using the 'action' attribute and how it is sent
                with the 'method' attribute. These are just some of the attributes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Attributes in a form element</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        I also didnt feel like doing this one so <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">here</a> is a link to form element
        info. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#forms">Here</a> are other elements used
        in conjunction with forms. If you cant find what you are looking for, take a look at the input element. It has
        many uses.

        <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>Almost everything in CSS follows this basic pattern</p>
        <span>selector {</span><br>
        <span> &emsp; property: value;</span><br>
        <span>}</span><br><br>
        <div>It is uncommon, but you can put a style element in the html head section and run css from there. Not so
            common, but you can do it. Stay away from doing inline styles (styling html using html)</div>
        <div>Linking html to css</div><br>
        <div>We link html to css using the link element as follows:</div><br>
        <div>&lt;link rel="stylesheets" href="nameOfYourCss&gt;</div><br>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">Here</a> are all of the css properties
            listed on MDN</div>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <div><b>Different syntax for colors</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Color Name</li>
            <li>RGB</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: rgb(#, #, #)</li>
                <li>Ranges from 0 to 255</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Hexadecimal</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax example: #FFFC00</li>
                <li>This works the same way as rgb but instead of going from 0 to 255, we go from 00 to FF. The first
                    two slots are for red, 3rd and 4th are for green, and 5th and 6th are for blue.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="sectionSixExample">Example</h2>

        <h2>Font Size</h2>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">Here</a> is a link to font size on MDN
        </div>
        <div>You can do font size with <b>absolute units</b> (most common = px) and <b>relative units</b> (most common =
            em and rem). Relative units are usually better to use, especially when making a responsive website.</div>

        <h2>Font Family</h2>
        <div>Font families are a little tricker because different browers might only have certain kinds of fonts. <a
                href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/">Here</a> is a website that shows the different fonts that various
            browsers use. A way to get around this is choosing multiple fonts so that if certain browers dont have your
            first choice, your second or third choice can be used. This is called a <b>font stack</b>. Along with doing
            that, it would be a good idea to choose a general font family such as sans-serif or monospaced. When
            choosing a general font family, the browser will just choose your font for you. Look at the link above to
            see what I mean.</div>

    <div id="sectionSeven">
        <h1>Section Seven</h1>
        <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ID - an ID selector is used for styling a single thing. Each ID specific to only 1 thing.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>#ID name {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Class - a class selector is used for multiple things. We can put several things into a class and style them all a certain way.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>.class name {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Descendant - a descendant selector is used to style something that is inside soemthing else. So if we want to style all paragraphs inside of a div a certain way, we would type in 'div space' in place of 'thing thing' below.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adjacent - the adjacent selector is used for styling something that comes immedietely after something on the same level. One is not inside (nested) inside of another, but is adjacent to it. Typing in h1 + p in place of thing + thing below would style all paragraphs that are immedietely after h1s.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing + thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Direct-Descendant - this is a lot like the desdendant selector, but it only applys to a child one level down.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing > thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                }</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Start back with the attribute selector video -->
            </ul>
        </ul>

    </div>
