        <h1>Section 3</h1>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language</i> and is used to build the structure of a document.</p>

        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <div>Elements are used in HTML to help separate, distinguish, categorize, etc. parts of a webpage.</div>
        <div>Syntax for an element: <b>&lt;<i> element type </i>&gt;<i> stuff </i>&lt; /<i> element type &gt;</i></p>
            </b> </div>

        <h3>Examples of Elements</h3>

        <div><b>Paragraph Element</b> - This is a block level element, so it will space itself with other elements.
        </div>
        <span>&lt;p&gt; <i>your paragraph...</i> &lt;/p&gt;</b></span>

        <div><b>Division Element</b> - Much like a paragraph element, this is a block-level element allowing for
            division of sections. This is good for grouping things together. But if another type of block-level element
            exists, use that instead. A div should really only be used as a last resort.</div>
        <div><b>Span Element</b> - Spans are inline elements. These can also be used for grouping things, such as
            individual words within a sentence. For example, when applying css to a nhtml document, adding spans within
            a paragraph can allow you to edit specific words in a sentence.</div>
        <span>&lt;div&gt; <i>your content...</i> &lt;/div&gt;</span>

        <div><b>h1 through h6 Elements</b> - These are header elements. There can only be a single h1 on a page, and the
            numerical value must be in ascending order. e.g. h2 must come before an h3, and an h3 must come before an
            h4.</div>
        <span>&lt;h1&gt; <i>your main header</i> &lt;/h1&gt;</span>
        <div>&lt;h2&gt; <i>your subheader</i> &lt;/h2&gt;</div>

        <h2>HTML Boilerplate</h2>
        <p>This is standardized markup that needs to be in every html document.</p>

        <h3>Boilerplate Parts</h3>

        <div><b>Doctype</b> - This tells the broswer what type of document it is reading.</div>
        <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

        <div><b>HTML Element</b> - This is the top-level element. Everything needs to go in here.</div>
        <span>&lt;html lang="en"&gt; <i>all your shit</i> &lt;/html&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Title</b> - This is the title of the page which is displayed in the browser tab. Browsers use the title
            element to create the links in the search results.</div>
        <span>&lt;title&gt; <i>your title</i> &lt;/title&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Head</b> - This is where all the metadata wil go.</div>
        <span>&lt;head&gt; <i>metadata</i> &lt;/head&gt;</span>

        <div><b>Body</b> - This is where all the content of the document will go.</div>
        <span>&lt;body&gt; <i>touch my body</i> &lt;/body&gt;</span>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <span>Lists can be nested inside one another (both ordered and unordered.)</span>

        <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
        <span>These are lists of things where order is not necessarily needed. This is done by creating a tag named ul
            with tags named li nested within. </span>

        <div>Syntax for unordered lists:</div>
        <div><b>&lt;<i>ul</i>&gt;</b></div>
        <span><b><i> &lt;<i>li</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/li</i>&gt;..... </i></b></span>
        <div><b>&lt; /<i>ul&gt;</i></p></b></div>

        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <span>These are lists where having an order is wanted. This is done by creating a tag named ol with tags named
            li nested within. </span>

        <div>Syntax for ordered lists:</div>
        <div><b>&lt;<i>ol</i>&gt;</b></div>
        <span><b><i> &lt;<i>li</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/li</i>&gt;..... </i></b></span>
        <div><b>&lt; /<i>ol&gt;</i></p></b></div>

        <h2>Anchor Tags</h2>
        <span>Anchor tags are typically used for providing a clickable link for navigation to another location. This is
            done by opening an 'a' tag, having the address specified immedietely after the a, naming the clickable
            portion between the tags, followed by a closing tag. When adding the location in the href attribute, the
            link will take you to the location relative to the current directory, if not otherwise specified. So, if we
            are working in a local directory and you want the link to go to google, make sure to add the
            http://www.</span>

        <div>Syntax for an anchor tag: <b><i> &lt;<i>a href="location"</i>&gt; stuff &lt;<i>/a</i>&gt; </i></b></div>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <span>There is only an opening tag for images. Much like the href attribute for an anchor tag, there is an
            attribute named src for images. Same with the anchor tag, the location of the image used is relative to the
            current html file being used. Another attribute may be used to help with accessibility, which is the alt
            attribute. This can be placed right after the src attribute which allows for a text description of the
            image. This will only show if the image cannot load properly, or if someone is using a screen reader.</span>
        <div><b>Syntax for Images: <i> &lt;<i>img src="img location"</i>&gt;</i></b></div>
        <div><b>Syntax for Images with alt attribute: <i> &lt;<i>img src="img location"
                        alt="description"</i>&gt;</i></b></div>


    </div>

    <div id="sectionFour">
        <h1>Section 4</h1>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Inline elements only take up the space that they need, so the extra space can be filled with something else.
        </p>
        <p>Examples of inline elements: spans, images, anchor tags</p>

        <h2>Block Elements</h2>
        <p>Block elements take up the entire line (block), so even if your content doesn't fill up the whole line, that
            extra space will still be reserved.</p>
        <p>Examples of block elements: divs, paragraphs, h1, h2, ...</p>
        <p>More about block elements, inline elements, and inline-block elements will be covered in css.</p>

        <h2>List of Elements</h2>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Here</a> is a link to all of the elements
            listed on MDN.</p>

        <h2>Entity Codes</h2>
        <p>These are codes for specific characters that we cannot normally type in. They all start with an '&' and end
            with an ';'. These should also be used for <b>Reserved characters</b>. These are characters such as '&lt;'
            and '&amp;'. Since they have a specific purpose in html, just typing it in normally might result in some
            confusion/problems. <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">Here</a> is a link to entity
            codes.</p>

        <h2>Semantic Markup (Meaningful Markup)</h2>
        <p>When choosing a type of element, try to choose one that has the best meaning for its purpose. For example,
            the 'main' element functions exactly like the generic 'div' element, but it indicates that the content
            inside is the main. Main and div function exactly the same, but main helps explain to people reading the
            code that what goes inside that element is the main content. These content sectioning elements can be seen
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning">here</a>.

    <div id="sectionFive">
        <h1>Section Five</h1>
        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <div><b>Table Elements</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;table&gt;: table element- everything just goes inside of this element</li>
            <li>&lt;td&gt;: table data cell element- defines a cell within a table</li>
            <li>&lt;tr&gt;: table row element- groups cells into a row</li>
            <li>&lt;th&gt;: table header cell element- defines a cell as being a header</li>
            <li>&lt;thead&gt;: table head element- groups rows into a head </li>
            <li>&lt;tbody&gt;: table body element- groups rows that are in the body of the table</li>
            <li>&lt;tfoot&gt;: table foot element- defines what rows are considered a footer</li>
            <li>&lt;colgroup&gt;: colgroup element- defines a group of columns in a table</li>
            <li>&lt;caption&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;col&gt;: col element- This is usually found within a colgroup element. Includes the attribute 'span'
            </li>
            <li>col span and row span can also just go inside of something like a td</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Honestly didn't feel like doing this section so I will just leave a link <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#table_content">here</a> to look at.
        </div>
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <div><b>Form elements</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;form&gt;: form element- This is basically just a shell for the other form elements to go into. It
                also specifies where the form data should be submitted using the 'action' attribute and how it is sent
                with the 'method' attribute. These are just some of the attributes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Attributes in a form element</li>
                </ul>
                &lt;input&gt;: used to create a variety of different form controls.
                <ul>
                    <li>The type of input alters the input's behavior and appearance. i.e. date pickers, checkboxes,
                        etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        I also didnt feel like doing this one so <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">here</a> is a link to form element
        info. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#forms">Here</a> are other elements used
        in conjunction with forms. If you cant find what you are looking for, take a look at the input element. It has
        many uses.

        <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>Almost everything in CSS follows this basic pattern</p>
        <span>selector {</span><br>
        <span> &emsp; property: value;</span><br>
        <span>}</span><br><br>
        <div>It is uncommon, but you can put a style element in the html head section and run css from there. Not so
            common, but you can do it. Stay away from doing inline styles (styling html using html)</div>
        <div>Linking html to css</div><br>
        <div>We link html to css using the link element as follows:</div><br>
        <div>&lt;link rel="stylesheets" href="nameOfYourCss&gt;</div><br>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">Here</a> are all of the css properties
            listed on MDN</div>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <div><b>Different syntax for colors</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Color Name</li>
            <li>RGB</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: rgb(#, #, #)</li>
                <li>Ranges from 0 to 255</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Hexadecimal</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax example: #FFFC00</li>
                <li>This works the same way as rgb but instead of going from 0 to 255, we go from 00 to FF. The first
                    two slots are for red, 3rd and 4th are for green, and 5th and 6th are for blue.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="sectionSixExample">Example</h2>
        <div id="sectionSixExample2">The word example above and this text can be an example of some common css

        <h2>Font Size</h2>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">Here</a> is a link to font size on MDN
        </div>
        <div>You can do font size with <b>absolute units</b> (most common = px) and <b>relative units</b> (most common =
            em and rem). Relative units are usually better to use, especially when making a responsive website.</div>

        <h2>Font Family</h2>
        <div>Font families are a little tricker because different browers might only have certain kinds of fonts. <a
                href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/">Here</a> is a website that shows the different fonts that various
            browsers use. A way to get around this is choosing multiple fonts so that if certain browers dont have your
            first choice, your second or third choice can be used. This is called a <b>font stack</b>. Along with doing
            that, it would be a good idea to choose a general font family such as sans-serif or monospaced. When
            choosing a general font family, the browser will just choose your font for you. Look at the link above to
            see what I mean.</div>

    </div>
    <div id="sectionSeven">
        <h1>Section Seven</h1>

        <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ID - an ID selector is used for styling a single thing. Each ID specific to only 1 thing.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>#ID name {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Class - a class selector is used for multiple things. We can put several things into a class and style
                them all a certain way.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>.class name {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Descendant - a descendant selector is used to style something that is inside soemthing else. So if we
                want to style all paragraphs inside of a div a certain way, we would type in 'div space' in place of
                'thing thing' below.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adjacent - the adjacent selector is used for styling something that comes immedietely after something on
                the same level. One is not inside (nested) inside of another, but is adjacent to it. Typing in h1 + p in
                place of thing + thing below would style all paragraphs that are immedietely after h1s.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing + thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Direct-Descendant - this is a lot like the desdendant selector, but it only applys to a child one level
                down.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing > thing {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Attribute - this is a way to select things based off a specific attribute that they have. For example,
                we might want to style all inputs that have type="text". So, we would put input in place of 'thing' and
                type='text' in place of 'attribute below.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>thing[attribute] {<br>
                    &emsp; property: value;<br>
                    }</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
        <div>These can be added to the end of a selector to modify an element during a specific state.</div>
        <div>Some examples include: </div>
        <ul>
            <li>thing:hover</li>
            <li>thing:first</li>
            <li>thing:first-child</li>
            <li>thing:active</li>
            <li>thing:not()</li>
            <li>thing:nth-child()</li>
            <li>thing:nth-of-type()</li>
        </ul>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">Here</a> is a list of all the
            pseudo classes</div>

        <h2>Pseudo Elements</h2>
        <div>These are like pseduo classes, but instead of styling the state of the element, it styles a specific part
            of the element: such as the first letter or text area when selected (highlighted)</div>
        <div>Some examples include:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>thing::first-letter</li>
            <li>thing::first-line</li>
            <li>thing::selection</li>
        </ul>
        <div><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements">Here</a> is a list of all the
            pseudo elements</div>

        <h2>Why is it Called Cascade</h2>
        <div>All this means is that the order we style things matters, assuming the same specificity. So if I made all
            h2s blue on a css document but then further down the document changed all h2s again to blue, all h2s would
            then be blue.</div>

        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <div>When multiple selectors are used to style soemthing, the more specific selector will win.</div>
        <div>Inline Styles (dont use these) > ID > Class, Attribute, & Pseudo-class Selectors > Element & Pseudo-element
            selectors</div>
        <div>There is also an exception called '!important'. This just always wins, but it should be use sparingly or
            never. To use !important, add it in as follows:</div><br>
        <span>selector {</span><br>
        <span> &emsp; property: value !important;</span><br>
        <span>}</span><br>

        <h2>Inheritence</h2>
        <div>A nested element(child) will inherit the styles of its parent unless otherwise specified. Certain things
            like buttons dont inherit the styles of their parents (closest parent), so if you want to, you can add the
            keyword inherit into css. Shown below: </div><br>
        <div><span>button {</span><br>
            <span> &emsp; property: inherit;</span><br>
            <span>}</span><br><br>
        </div>

    </div>

            <li>Border-radius: Used to round the corners of an elements outer border edge. This is also a shorthand. You
                can modify each corner if you'd like. <a

                <ul>
                    <li> Box-sizing: content-box; - This is the default setting, which makes the width and height
                        property modify the content box.</li>
                    <li> Box-sizing: border-box; - This is an alternate setting that includes the padding and border

            </li>
            <li>Padding: Modifys the size of the padding. you can also change the amount of padding for each side. This
                is also a shorthand, and you can change the amount of padding for each side with different syntax. You
                can also use all the individual properites to do this. <a

        <h2>Display Property</h2>
        <div>The display property has a bunch of options to choose from, but we will focus mostly on <span
                class="bold">inline</span>, <span class="bold">block</span>, and <span class="bold">inline-block</span>
        </div>

        <h3>Inline</h3>
        <div>Width and height are ignored. Margin and padding push elements away horizontally, but not vertically.</div>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <div>Look at how the padding/margin is ignored vertically, but is respected horizontally. Also, if you look at
            the code, I made the width and height super big but they are also being ignored.</div>

        <h3>Block</h3>
        <div>I didnt make an example because this one is more intuitive</div>
        <div>Block elements break the flow of a document. Width, height, margin, and padding are all respected.</div>

        <h3>Inline-Block</h3>
        <div>This is basically the same as a block, but it doesnt take up all the dead dpace it doesn't use.</div>
        <div>Behave like an inline element except width, height, margin, and padding are respected.</div>

        <h2>CSS Units</h2>
        <h3>Percentages</h3>
        <div>Percentages are relative to some other value so it is taking a percentage from its parent or the element
            itself. The height and width property for example take from the parent. Line-height takes from itself, so if
            an element has a font-size of 40px and a line-height of 200%, the line height will be 80px.</div>

        <h3>em</h3>
        <div>ems are also a relative unit and for font size it is relative to their parent. For other properties, it is
            relative to itself (see example below). So for font, 1em is the same as its parent and 2em is twice the size
            of its parent. For things like magin/padding, it would be relative to the element itself. </div>
        <h4>Example</h4>

        <section id="emSection">
            <div id="emExample">My name E G Jeff</div>
            <div>This first one has a left and right margin of 1em</div>
            <div id="emExample2">My name is Franklin</div>
            <div>This second one has a left and right margin of 3em</div>
            <div id="emExample3">My name is shlenck</div>
            <div>This third example also has a left and right margin of 3em, but since the font is smaller the margin is
                smaller</div>
        </section><br>
        <div>One thing to think about is nesting elements. If we make the fonts of everything in ems they will
            grow/shrink for each nested element.</div>

        <h3>rem</h3>
        <div>rems are relative to the root html elements font size, so if the root html font size is 20px, 1rem is 20px
        </div>

    </div>

    <div id="sectionNine"></div>
    <h1>Section Nine</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Channel</h2>
    <div>The alpha channel can be added after rgb to affect the transparancy of a property. It goes from 0 to 1. So
        instead of just rgb(#, #, #), it would look like <span class="bold">rgba(#, #, #, #).</span></div>

    <h2>Opacity Property</h2>
    <div>This is like the alpha channel, but instead of just applying to one specific property, it will govern the
        entire element, including all of its descendants. Opacity also goes from 0 to 1.</div>

    <h2>Position Property</h2>
    <div>Just read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position">this</a>. It is actually a pretty
        important one so actually read it. There is a lot of detailed info so I thought the website would explain it
        better.</div>

    <h2>Transition Property</h2>
    <h3>The transtion property is shorthand for:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Transition-property: This is the property you want to edit.</li>
        <li>Transition-duration: This is how long you want the transition to occur, from begining to end.</li>
        <li>Transition-delay: This is how long you want the transition to wait until it starts.</li>
        <li>Transition-timing-function: This is the "path" that the transition takes to get from beginning to end. Like
            starting fast and slowing down at the end.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <div id="transitionExample1"> <span class="bold">Transition-property:</span> background-color <span
            class="bold">Transition-duration:</span> 2s</div><br>

    <section id="transitionSection">
        <div id="transitionExample2"><span class="bold">Transition-property:</span> background-color & margin-left <br>
            <span class="bold">Transition-duration:</span> 3s <br> <span class="bold">Transition-delay:</span> 0.5s <br>
            <span class="bold">Transition-timing-function:</span> ease-in-out
        </div>
    </section><br>

    <div id="transitionExample3"><span class="bold">Transition-property:</span> background-color & margin-left <br>
        <span class="bold">Transition-duration:</span> 3s <br> <span class="bold">Transition-delay:</span> 0.5s <br>
        <span class="bold">Transition-timing-function:</span> ease-in-out
    </div><br>

    <div>The second and third example are exactly the same, but I put the second one inside of a section to help with
        the hovering effect. Test it out and you will see what I mean.</div>

    <h2>Google Fonts</h2>
    <div>If we wanted to make sure someones machine will load our page with a specific font, we can add that font to our
        css using google fonts. This makes the webpage fetch the font from google and load it before the webpage opens,
        ensuring a homogenous font across all users.</div><br>
    <div>To do this, we go <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">here</a>, then choose the fonts/weights that we want.
        Next we get the link from the site and paste it into the head. The website will also show you what to type into
        your css to access the font.
